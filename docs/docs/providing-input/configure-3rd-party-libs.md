# How to test components that use 3rd party libraries

General introduction about what is usually required: Mimic setup guide from lib in test.

Talk about following section containing specific instructions for 3rd parter libraries.

Add how to for test setup of tests that use Telerik, SyncFusion, etc. libraries. They often have IJsRuntime or other services that needs mocking or setup, before a test can run.

The how to should be as minimal as possible, preferably with links to vendors own documentation, so we do not have to keep it up to date if the vendor changes something in their library.
