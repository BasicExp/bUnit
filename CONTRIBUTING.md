# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?
Start a discussion on the [issues list](https://github.com/egil/bunit/issues).

## Bugs and feature requests?
For bugs or feature requests, log a new issue in [issues list](https://github.com/egil/bunit/issues)

## Contributing code and content

bUnit accept fixes and features! Here is what you should do when writing code for bUnit:

- Follow the coding conventions used in the project. In general, they align with the AspNetCore teams [coding guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines#coding-guidelines).
- Add, remove, or delete unit tests to cover your changes. Make sure tests are specific to the changes you are making. Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
- All code changes should be done on the `DEV` branch, and pull requests should target it.
- All updates to the documentation, located under `./docs/` should be done on the `MASTER` branch **if** they are general in nature and not tied to a specific version.

Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.

* ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/egil/bunit/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.
* ["Good first issue" issues](https://github.com/egil/bunit/labels/good%20first%20issue) - these are a good for newcomers.

### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute to one of our repositories, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix. If you are submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the us first. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. All code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the bUnit team, and only those that meet an high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

### Submitting a pull request

You will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/) when submitting your pull request. To complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), you will need to follow the instructions provided by the CLA bot when you send the pull request. This needs to only be done once for any .NET Foundation OSS project.

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. The coding, style, and general engineering guidelines are published on the [Engineering guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines) page.
